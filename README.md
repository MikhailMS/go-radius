# Golang RADIUS Protocol
Pure (as far as this code goes) implementation of RADIUS protocol in Go


Rationale behind this project:
1. Practice Golang
2. I already have RADIUS protocol implemented in Rust & V-language, so having it in Go would also be cool (although I know there is already implementation in Go)


## Installation
```
import "github.com/MikhailMS/go-radius"
```


## Tests
1. `go test`


## Minimum Supported Version of Golang (MSVG)
1. `1.20.5`


## Notes
1. This is re-write of [Rust implementation of RADIUS protocol](https://github.com/MikhailMS/rust-radius)
